# Strava Data Exploration

## What am I up to?

I love cycling and data, so an opportunity to combine the two wasn't something I could easily pass up.
At the epicenter of the marriage between cycling and data lies the power meter, which unlocks a host of capabilities
for a cyclist.
Most cyclists have computers which collect and/or display data.
All of my personal data is uploaded
to Strava after each ride.
Strava provides some interesting insights around exertion, overall speed, comparison of current performance to past
performance, etc.  I, however, want to dive more deeply into the data to truly begin to assess any and all improvements
in my fitness level.

With the ability to precisely measure the force being applied to the pedals, we can then gauge
how hard the body is working through heart rate data.
In theory, as fitness improves, the amount of effort required to achieve any given level of power **should** decrease.
